- 👀 I’m interested in picking up where I left off 35 years ago, yes that's vague.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use my mind for fun again.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate ... not yet.
- 📫 How to reach me ... not yet.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm older and you might assume I don't understand tech because of that. WRONG.
